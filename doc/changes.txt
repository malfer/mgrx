2022-08-11 ----------- MGRX 1.4.1 released
2022-08-09 Deleted src/grgui/textarea.c and his references. It was deprecated
           but it had references to non existent functions, so linking with the
           shared library failed (reported by Panagiotis Papasotiriou).
2022-07-31 ----------- MGRX 1.4.0 released
2022-07-25 Two new GrGUI functions:
             void GUIObjectUpdList(GUIObject *o, void **reg, int nreg, int vreg, int sreg);
             void GUIObjectUpdDList(GUIObject *o, void **reg, int nreg, int sreg);
           they let update the List parameters without access through the
           GUIObject struct.
           Speedy a bit the load of sparse fonts.
           List and DList objects can have zero registers.
2022-07-25 Added two unicode fonts to the fonts subdirectorie:
             unifont.fnt  16 16 proportional 5
               Converted from Unifont, dual license, GPL2 & OFL, 57071 glyphs
             unimk20.fnt  20 20 proportional 5
               Converted from Markus Kuhn X11 misc-fixed unicode fonts, using
               the 10x20 and 20x20ja fonts, public domain, 23098 glyphs
             Both font are sparse proportional fonts, but really are fixed ones
             with single and double wide chars.
2022-07-16 Added sparse attribute to the GrFontHeader struct and let fonts to
           be sparse, with glyphs undefined between min and max glyphs. This is
           achieved simply letting the width of a glyph to be zero and obviusly
           not having associated bitmap, so the offset attribute is irrelevant.
           The font can be sparse if the sparse attribute is true. Fonts drivers
           could set it when loading a font. At this moment only the grx format
           can be sparse and only for proportional fonts using the same trick
           mentioned. Note that loading a sparse proportional grx font will fail
           in previous MGRX versions. The motivation for this change is to be
           able to build unicode encoded fonts that only include a subset of
           characters without them becoming huge files.
           Changed all necesary source code to support sparse fonts.
           Added usedefg and defglyph attributes to the GrFontHeader struct to
           let fonts declare a default glyph, that funcionality will be added
           later.
2022-07-15 New funtion that bypass the normal MGRX algo to find a font:
             GrFont *GrLoadFontFile(char *name, char *driver);
           Solved bug in _GrScanPolygon, when scaning big polygons sometimes
           the scan table overflowed.
           Solved bug in src/wideline/drwcpoly.c, the intersect1 doesn't work
           well if the generate rectangles are near paralells, so check and
           use intersect2 in that cases. Nevertheless a better code is nedded.
           Move licenses to the licenses subdir and clarify copying.grx.
           New test/polytedb.c double buffer version of polytest.c
2022-03-27 ----------- MGRX 1.3.6 released
2022-03-18 For the W32 driver changed theALT_0..9,A..Z recognition to be more
           generic and work for any keboard (like the Greek one)
2022-03-18 Solved bugs in test/keys.c
2022-03-14 Solved a very old bug, an invalid read, in some drawbitmap functions
2022-03-07 The w32 input driver recognize codepages 1251 and 1253 and sets
           kbsysencoding to GRENC_CP1251 or GRENC_CP1253. GRENC_CP1252
           continues to be the default.
2022-03-07 The w32 input driver recognize GrKey_Alt_Return (default to activate
           the grgui menu bar)
2022-02-22 The input code now can compose characters from hexadecimal input, it
           is disabled by default. To enable it use the new function:
             void GrSetComposeKey(int compkey);
           after the input driver is initiated, e.g. GrSetComposeKey(GrKey_Alt_U);
           After that use the compose-key and up to four hexadecimal digits for
           GRENC_UTF_8 and GRENC_UCS_2, only two for the rest user encodings.
2022-02-18 Added two new user encodings and its correspondant text encodings an
           font encodings, to be able to detect (and use) the Greek and Cyrillic
           codepages in W32:
             GRENC_CP1251, GRENC_CP1253
             GR_CP1251_TEXT, GR_CP1253_TEXT
             GR_FONTENC_CP1251, GR_FONTENC_CP1253
2022-02-15 Added two new fonts px16x36.fnt and px16x36b.fnt derived from the
           px8x18.fnt, public domain, GR_FONTENC_CP437EXT coded.
2022-02-13 Changes to the clipboard interface
             you can pass GR_CB_NOLIMIT to GrSetClipBoardMaxChars, by default
             it is 32000 chars,
             GrPutClipBoard now returns the number of chars really copied,
             an extra parameter to GrGetClipBoardLen(int *partloaded)
             if not NULL it returns true if the last clipboard coppy operation
             (even internal or from the system clipboard in X11 and W32) was
             partially loaded, by aplying the maxchar limit.
2022-02-11 GUIOBJTYPE_ENTRY stores text internally as GR_UCS2_TEXT, so
           copy/paste retains the correct unicode value even if the font
           does not have the glyph.
2022-02-11 On W32 the clipboard interact with the W32 clipboard,
           GrIsClipBoardReadyToGet will load the W32 clipboard if the W32
           clipboard sequence number has changed from the last time it was
           loaded. It returns only 1 or 0 in any case.
2022-02-08 On X11 the clipboard interact with the X11 clipboard,
           GrIsClipBoardReadyToGet will return -1 if we don't own the selection
           and a system clipboard request was issued. Returns 1 if we own the
           selection or after a GREV_CBREPLY event with p1=1 was generated.
           Returns 0 if we own the selection and is empty or there are no
           selection owner.
           GrClearClipBoard will set the clipboard owner to None if we were
           owning it.
2022-02-07 Changed the clipboard interface:
             void GrSetClipBoardMaxChars(int maxchars);
             void GrClearClipBoard(void);
             void GrPutClipBoard(void *buf, int len, int chrtype);
             int GrIsClipBoardReadyToGet(void);
             void *GrGetClipBoard(int maxlen, int chrtype);
             int GrGetClipBoardLen(void);
           use GrPutClipBoard to put data in the clipboard
           use GrIsClipBoardReadyToGet before get data from the clipboard, it
           will return 1 if data is ready, 0 if the clipboard is empty or -1
           if data will be get from the system clipboard, and you must wait for
           a GREV_CBREPLY event with p1=1 to get de data. When ready use
           GrGetClipBoardLen to know the data len (in charactes) before to
           get the data with GrGetClipBoard.
           In the generic implementation the clipboard is internal to the progran
           so GrIsClipBoardReadyToGet will return 1 or 0 only.
2022-02-07 Added function to recode to/from UTF8 string to any:
             unsigned char *GrTextRecodeToUTF8(const void *text,int length,int chrtype);
             void *GrTextRecodeFromUTF8(const unsigned char *text,int length,int chrtype);
2022-02-06 Added function to recode from UCS2 string to any:
             void *GrTextRecodeFromUCS2(const unsigned short *text,int length,int chrtype);
           Moved the (internal) clipboard from GrGUI to MGRX, so we can use the
           system clipboard in X11 and W32 later. By now only internal and
           only can put/get UCS2 text. Added functions in input/clb_gen.c:
             void GrPutUCS2ClipBoard(unsigned short *buf, int len);
             int GrGetUCS2ClipBoard(unsigned short *buf, int maxlen);
             int GrGetUCS2ClipBoardLen(void);
2022-02-02 Expanded the upper-lower unicode table to characters in the
           GR_FONTENC_MGRX512 font encoding. New src/input/uperlowr.c file with
           the conversion functions, using a binary search:
             unsigned short GrUCS2tolower(unsigned short chr);
             unsigned short GrUCS2toupper(unsigned short chr);
             long GrUTF8toupper(long chr);
             long GrUTF8tolower(long chr);
2022-01-26 Make the GrGUI scrollbars more responsible
2022-01-23 New GrGUI struct GUIRawTEdit and functions, a raw text editor to
             be used by the new panel editor and the new editor object
           New GrGUI struct GUITextPanel and functios, deprecates GUITextArea
           Modified testgui/grgui09.c and testgui/demintl2 to use a GUITextPanel
             instead the deprecated GUITextArea
           New GrGUI Object GUIOBJTYPE_EDIT, a text editor that can be added to
             a group of objects, internally uses a GUIRawTEdit struct
           Modified testgui/demintl2 to exercise the new GUIOBJTYPE_EDIT
2022-01-18 Added a new internal mouse cursor GR_MCUR_TYPE_GLASS
2022-01-10 Added a new color table to mgrxcolr.h the ANSI one with 256 defined colors
           Modified test/clrtable.c to exercise the new table
           Center GUIOBJTYPE_TEXT vertically
           Showing last partial register in GUIOBJTYPE_LIST and GUIOBJTYPE_DLIST
2021-12-28 ----------- MGRX 1.3.5 released
2021-12-23 Added new functions:
             int GUITilesGetSelected(void);
             returns the idt of the selected tile
             void GUITilesSetSelected(int idt, int paint);
             sets the selected tile and repaint borders if paint != 0
             int GUIGroupGetSelected(GUIGroup *g);
             returns the id of the selected object
2021-12-22 Added a new function
             void GrSetMinWindowDims(int width, int height);
             it sets the minimal window dimensions when window resize support is active
           Added more kesyms to src/input/x11keys.h to see if ALT+letter works with the 
             Greek keyboard
2021-12-18 New GrGUI function:
             void GUIMenuBarSetShortCut(long key);
             it sets the shortcut to activate the menubar, by default it is
             GrKey_Alt_Return. It must be a special key
           New utility MGRX functions:
             long GrUTF8toupper(long chr);
             long GrUTF8tolower(long chr);
             Add this moment only works for latin and greek chars and spanish Ñ
           Now in GrGUI menues options can be selected with upper and lower chars
             for Latin and Greek chars and the spanish Ñ
           Menubar menues can be activate with Alt+letter for greek chars
           The X11 input driver now generates GrKey_Alt_A to GrKey_Alt_Z when
             CapsLock is on
2021-12-08 When use i18n ids:
             -make shortcuts in menues works with utf-8 strings
             -solve a bug in menubar, shotcuts must be ALT+letters
           Smooth wIndow resizing:
             -use a big DIB and reuse it in the Win32 driver
             -use a big backingstore and reuse it in the X11 driver
2021-12-07 Added GR_DRIVERF_WINDOW_RESIZE flag. Both win32 and x11 video drivers set
             it in their GrVideoDriver.drvflags when user window resize is supported
             so a user program can check it is active checking
             GrCurrentVideoDriver()->drvflags & GR_DRIVERF_WINDOW_RESIZE
2021-12-05 Try fixing warning in gcc 11 with the definition of GrGenerateEllipseArc and
             GrGenerateEllipse (reported by Panagiotis Papasotiriou)
2021-12-05 Allow window resizing on windowed platforms, step 6
           Changes to the w32 video driver:
             Process WM_NCMOUSEMOVE event, in w10 there are no  WM_NCHITTEST event over
               the caption title, so the mouse pointer disappeared there
             When window resize support is active create a maximum DIB and reuse it so
               transitions in window resizes are smooth now
             Modified the grgui12.c to demonstrate language change using the MGRX
               catalog implementation and specific GrGUI functions for menus
             Added Greek to grgui12.c (by Panagiotis Papasotiriou)
2021-12-02 Allow window resizing on windowed platforms, step 5
           Updated the MGRX and GrGUI programmer's guides.
2021-11-24 Allow window resizing on windowed platforms, step 4
           Modified the W32 driver to support window resizing
           GrSetMode (X11 & W32) only set the window title if not set previosly by the
             program. The W32 driver uses now the same tile format that the X11 one.
           VESA driver: the string option must begin with "vesa" to not colide with
             other driver options (like "rszwin"), now must be "vesa[5][p][f][r][b]"
             (really the opional letters order doesn't matter).
2021-11-21 Allow window resizing on windowed platforms, step 3
           When window resize support is up (using the "rszwin option") and for not
             to fight with the window manager, it is necesary a different procedure
             to set the graphics mode after a GREV_WSZCHG or if it is program-specified.
             Call "GrSetMode(GR_default_text)" before set the new graphics mode
             when it is program-specified, do not call it after a GREV_WSZCHG, so that
             the X11 driver can know what to do (see testgui/demintl2.c for an
             example).
           Added minwgw,minwgh members to the GrDriverInfo struct, like the
             minimal window dimensions when resizing support is up, the default
             value is 320,240. Can be changed setting the new environment variable
             MGRXMINWG.
           Ignore the first GREV_WSZCHG if there are more in queue.
2021-11-17 Allow window resizing on windowed platforms, step 2
           New GrGUI function:
             void GUITASetPanel(GUITextArea *ta, GUIPanel *p)
             you can use it to reasign an existing GUITextArea to a new GUIPanel
             after a window resize.
           Test programs:
             New GRX test program wrsztest.c
             New GRX+GrGUI test program grgui12.c
             Modified showfnt2.c and demintl2.c
2021-11-10 Allow window resizing on windowed platforms, step 1
           Added GREV_WSZCHG event
           Added GrSetDriverExt(char *drvspec, char *drvopt) function,
             you must call GrSetDriverExt(NULL, "rszwin"); before GrSetMode, to request
             window resize support to the default driver, them it will sends GREV_WSZCHG
             when the window size changes.
           Modified the X11 driver to support window resizing
           GrGUI: common dialogs and GUIDialogRun now returns -2 if canceled with a
             GREV_WMEND event, and -3 if canceled with a GREV_WSZCHG event,
             the GREV_WSZCHG event is reenqueued
           GrGUI: menues will be canceled with a GREV_WSZCHG event,
             the GREV_WSZCHG event is reenqueued
2021-02-15 Get rid of alloca, using dinamic buffers or malloc
2020-07-07 ----------- MGRX 1.3.4 released

           GrPatternDrawStringExt in subcontext.
2020-06-18 Solved an old bug in GrPatternFilledLine when drawing in subcontext.
2020-06-01 Use only int arithmetic in png2ctx.c
2020-04-10 ----------- MGRX 1.3.3 released
2020-04-08 Workarround to solve a race condition in W10, sometimes hDCMem
           was used before it was ready.
2020-03-24 To help use the i18n catalog, added the field "sid" to GUIMenuItem
           and GUIMenuBarItem, so menus and the bar menu continue to be
           defined statically, without populate the "title" and "key" fields,
           and them use this new funcions:
             void GUIMenusSetI18nFields(void);
             void GUIMenuBarSetI18nFields(void);
2020-03-24 Added to MGRX a catalog implementation to help internationalize
           programs, it doesn't depend of any other mgrx function and it
           is Chrtype agnostic (this is why (void *) is used). The functions:
             int GrI18nInit(int nlg, int nstr, void *defstr);
             void GrI18nEnd(void);
             int GrI18nSetLabel(int lid, void *label);
             void * GrI18nGetLabel(int lid);
             int GrI18nSetLang(int lid);
             void GrI18nAddStrings(int lid, int fsid, int nums, void **str);
             void * GrI18nGetString(int sid);
           New test program to test the catalog: test/i18ntest.c
2020-03-20 New GUIObject field "visible", if 0 the object is ignored within
           the group. After GUIObjectSet.. the object is visible by default,
           its value can be changed using the new function:
             void GUIGroupSetVisible(GUIGroup *g, int id, int visible);
           After doing changes in visibility it is necesary to set the
           correct GUIContext and call the function:
             void GUIGroupRestartAfterVisibleChanges(GUIGroup *g);
           that recalculates the selected object and paints the visible objects.
2020-03-15 Added GUI component GUIRawDataList2 a generic version of
           GUIRawDataList, that can handle generic registers, not only
           strings, to substitute it in the future, for now to be used by
           GUIOBJTYPE_REGLIST.
           Added new object: GUIOBJTYPE_REGLIST, a deployed list of registers.
2020-03-07 New menu item type GUI_MI_TITLE to show a menu title.
           Added 'border' field to the GUIMenu structure, if =1 a thick
           border is drawn around the menu.
           New function:
             void GUIMenusSetColors2(GrColor bgt, GrColor fgt, GrColor inb);
           to set the bg and fg title colors and the inner color border.
2020-02-20 New GrGUI function:
             int GUIMenuGetDims(int idmenu, int *width, int *height);
           to know the menu dimensions before running it.
2020-02-18 New GrGUIfunctions:
             void GUIDBPauseBltsToScreen(void);
             void GUIDBRestartBltsToScreen(void);
           can be used to pause and restart the blts performed by
           GUIDBCurCtxBltToScreen and GUIDBCurCtxBltRectToScreen when in
           double buffer mode, so it is easy to control the real screen update
           when necesary.
2020-02-02 New testgui program "showfnt2", show the MGRX font collection using
           the new GUIOBJTYPE_DLIST object to select the font.
2020-02-01 New GUI component GUIRawDataList mainly for use by GUIOBJTYPE_LIST
           and the new GUIOBJTYPE_DLIST, a deployed list.
2020-01-30 Restructured internal GrGUI code when using double buffer. Now
           all the blits to screen are managed by this two functions:
             void GUIDBCurCtxBltToScreen(void);
             void GUIDBCurCtxBltRectToScreen(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2);
           they copy the whole or a rect from the current context to the screen
           context, obviusly the current context must be the global context or
           a subcontext of it, like the one provided by GUIContext.
           Both functions do nothing if the double buffer is no enabled.
           Renamed GUIManageExposeEvents to GUIDBManageExposeEvents.
2020-01-26 Updated from ASCII to ISO8859-1 all cour, helv & tms fonts.
           Errors in lucb40b.fnt, lucb40bi.fnt, lucb40.fnt, lucb40i.fnt
           and lucs40.fnt have been corrected.
           Checked baseline correctness for most fonts (except xm fonts).
2020-01-22 Updated all tmgrx fonts from the last Terminus font distribution,
           applying the variants dv1, ij1 and td1.
2020-01-19 Updated testgui/demintl2.c test program to cover the new font
           encoding.
2020-01-19 Added the three new fonts as built-in fonts ready to use:
           GrFont_PX8x18, GrFont_PX11x22 and GrFont_PX14x28
2020-01-19 Added three fonts that are GR_FONTENC_CP437EXT coded,
           px8x18.fnt, px11x22.fnt and px14x28.fnt. They are derived
           from pc public domain fonts.
2020-01-18 New font encoding GR_FONTENC_CP437EXT a custom encoding that
           cover CP437 + ISO8859-1 + CP1252 (by now). The encoding details
           are described in doc/cp437ext.txt
2020-01-11 ----------- MGRX 1.3.2 released
2020-01-10 Added two new font encodings GR_FONTENC_ISO_8859_5 and
           GR_FONTENC_ISO_8859_7.
2020-01-06 Updated programmer's guides.
2020-01-04 testgui demo grgui11.c uses GrStretchBlt.
2019-11-26 New 32bpp memory framedrivers in src/newfdrv that uses only C
           standard bit operations and C standard functions. Not used by now,
           they will be activate in a future release.
2019-11-23 Added setmark parameter to GUITAMoveCursor and GUITAMoveCursorRel,
           if =1 clear marked area, =-1 extend marked area, =0 do nothing.
           Changed names of GUITADrawChar and GUITADrawString to
           GUITAPutChar and GUITAPutString. They describe best its function.
2019-11-22 GUIScrollbar new specific events GREV_SCBVERT and GREV_SCBHORZ,
           with p1 = new lift inivalue. Events are sent when clicking over or
           under the lift and when dragging the lift.
           Changed GUITextArea mini editor to respond to the new events.
           Changed GUITextArea cursor movement behaviour to be similar
           to other modern editors.
2019-11-19 Added mark capabilities (with keys and mouse) and (internal)
           clipboard interaction to the GUITextArea mini editor.
2019-11-17 First work to add clipboard interaction to GrGUI.
           In GUIOBJTYPE_ENTRY objects you can mark text with shift+cursor
           keys or the mouse and reacts to ^C ^X ^V. The clipboard is internal
           to the program (by now).
2019-11-13 The xwin and win32 drivers generate GREV_WMEND events when requested.
           Modified the testgui/demmgrx2.c to request GREV_WMEND events (and
           handle them).
2019-11-12 Preparation for the new GREV_WMEND event, generated in windowing
           systems when user click the close window button and the programmer
           has equested it. New function:
             void GrEventGenWMEnd(int when)
           "when" can be GR_GEN_WMEND_NO (the default) or GR_GEN_WMEND_YES.
2019-11-10 ----------- MGRX 1.3.1 released
2019-11-07 For the GrGUI entry object we draw first the object in
           memory, so blinking cursor can be draw faster.
2019-11-01 changes to src/fonts/fdv_xwin.c, the X11 font driver,
           calculate properly char dimensions, so that there aren't
           cut characters.
2019-10-28 New function:
             void GUIGroupSetText(GUIGroup *g, int id, void *newtext);
           Update the text propertie of an object (by now only for entries).
2019-10-27 Two new GUITile types:
             GUI_TT_ACTIVEBWVSCB and GUI_TT_ACTIVEBWHSCB
           Tiles with only Vertical or Horizontal scrollbar.
2019-10-26 New function:
             GUITile * GUITileGetPointer(int idt);
           returns a pointer to the registered tile idt.
           New function:
             int GUITilesProcessTileEvent(GrEvent *ev, int idt);
           sends a even to a specific registered tile to be processed.
           even if it isn't the active tile.
2019-10-24 The functions GrDumpFont, GrDumpFnaFont and GrDumpGrxFont now
           returns an int, 1=succes, 0=fail
2019-10-22 Added SubstructureRedirectMask to go/return from fullsecreen in
           vd_xwin.c. Now go to fullscrenn works in Raspbian X11.
2019-10-20 Added new function to stretch blit a context to another:
           void GrStretchBlt(GrContext *dst,int dx1,int dy1,int dx2,int dy2,
             GrContext *src,int x1,int y1,int x2,int y2,GrColor oper);
2019-10-17 ----------- MGRX 1.3.0 released
2019-10-16 Added new section to the programer's manual:
           "Recode to/from GR_UCS2_TEXT chartype"
2019-10-15 Solved a bug in the W32 videodriver, when changing modes without
           exiting, we need to delete the old hDCMem and generate a new one.
2019-10-13 Moved test graphics files to the testimg subdirectory, so
           both normal tests and GrGUI tests can use them.
2019-10-13 Added GrGUI to MGRX. GrGUI is a mini Graphics User Interface
           specifically designed for MGRX. The added code consist of:
           - the src/grgui subdirectory with the GrGUI library functions.
           - the include/grgui.h main include file.
           - the doc/grguipm.htm file, the GrGUI programmer's guide.
           - the testgui subdirectory with demo GrGUI programs, includes
           demmgrx2, demintl2 and eleven examples used in the pm.
           By default GrGUI is included in the MGRX library, but a
           switch is provided in makedefs.grx to exclude it.
2019-10-07 New recode utility functions:
           unsigned short GrCharRecodeToUCS2(long chr,int chrtype);
           long GrCharRecodeFromUCS2(long chr,int chrtype);
           unsigned short *GrTextRecodeToUCS2(const void *text,int length,
                                              int chrtype);
2019-09-19 Remove RAM3x8 framedriver and a lot of conditional compilation
           defines, really we have never used it.
2019-09-19 Solved a bug in vd_mem.c, missing color component positions in the
           24 bpp videomode.
2019-09-16 Use the more accurate clock_getres function in GrMsecTime function
           (Linux console and x11 versions). For old glibc versions (< 2.17)
           it is necesary setting NEED_LIBRT to "y" in makedefs.grx
2019-09-13 demomgrx showes the screen and ram framebuffers modes.
2019-09-13 New function:
           char *GrFrameDriverName(GrFrameMode m);
           returns a short text describing the GrFrameMode given.
2019-09-11 ----------- mGRX 1.2.0 released
2019-09-11 Polished GrFrameMode enum type in mgrx.h
2019-09-09 New specific and faster frame drivers for 32bpp and 16 bpp linux
           framebuffer, written from scratch. For 8bpp and 24bpp the generic
           frame drivers are still used, because I don't have any plattform
           to test those modes.
2019-09-07 Added support for ARM (tested in a Raspberry Pi 4 using Raspbian).
           Both console framebuffer and X11 drivers work, only a few changes in
           makefiles and include files was necesary. The console framebuffer
           works better than the i386 version on top of a Nvida card (today
           little attention is paid to the support of console framebuffer by
           video drivers). The X11 version is a bit slow and have some glitches,
           the big one is that the xserver ignore any function to draw except
           GXcopy.
2019-08-27 ----------- mGRX 1.1.2 released
2019-08-25 Solved an old bug showing in 16 color modes. The defaut red mouse
           allocated a cell with a red color not in the ega color table, so if
           GrAllocEgaColors() is called after mouse initialization the last ega 
           color (white) can't be alloced. Solution: setting the default mouse
           color to black & white and allocate black & white colors first in
           GrAllocEgaColors() to prevent no cells for the two basic colors.
2019-08-24 GREV_EXPOSE event populates "count" in the "kbstat" field. If count is
           zero, no more Expose events follow. The X11 man pages say: Simple
           applications that do not want to optimize redisplay can just ignore all
           Expose events with nonzero counts and perform full redisplays on events
           with zero counts.
2019-08-22 Decorate demomgrx background.
2019-08-19 Added "life_db" test program, double buffer version of life, much faster
           than the normal version in X11 and Win32, a bit slower in Linux-fb
           and djgpp.
2019-08-18 Don't recode ASCII keys (include controls) when reading keyboard, it can
           hide the control keys in MSDOS and Win32.
2019-08-17 Solved a bug in libgrx.h getting BYTE_ORDED showed in win32 after remove
           of assembler code in memfill.h.
2019-08-14 Removed assembler code from src/include/memfill.h, tested all platforms.
2019-08-13 Moved sttcopy and sttzero to libgrx.h using string.h routines. Deleted
           includes memcopy.h and memfill.h for files that do not need them now.
2019-08-13 Restaured "CCOPT += -DLFB_BY_NEAR_POINTER" in src/makefile.lnx because
           the framebuffer is in user space.  we can now remove lfb--.o files
           from the linuxfb build.
2019-08-12 Checking the 32 bit build in linux I had unespected segment violation
           with the fb friver, the cause was the i386 assembler code used by sttcopy
           function. Because I don't know how to debug assembler, and it is not used
           in the 64 bit build, and have not found speed difference with and without
           the assembler code in other 32 bit plattforms (like DJGPP) I deleted
           the i386 assembler code in src/include/memcopy.h. As far as the DJGPP
           and Win32 versions will continue to run I will try to eliminate more
           assembler code in future.
2019-08-10 Updated the programmer manual explaining how to use the portable color
           tables defined in mgrxcolr.h
2019-08-03 Changed the obsolete termio by termios in the linux framebuffer input driver,
           this solve problems with control keys.
2019-08-02 Added support for the imps2 mouse protocol in the linux framebuffer input
           driver, now we have wheel events.
2019-06-20 Added color tables (new concept) for easy use of colors by names, there are
           two tables defined: EGA (16 colors) and WEB (138 colors). The definitions are
           in the new main include file include/mgrxcolr.h and the necesary code in
           src/setup/colortbl.c. Added the clrtable.c program to test color tables.
2019-06-11 ----------- mGRX 1.1.1 released
2019-06-10 Solved a very old problem in Customized and Patterned line drawings
           funtions. The intersect code (in src/wideline/drwcpoly.c) gave bad results
           for solid and pattern filed wide lines, changed to a simple algorithm that
           works very well, except for circles and dashed lines, so we use part of the
           original code for these cases.
           Added the cusptest.c program to test Customized and Patterned line drawings.
2017-10-01 New functions:
           reverse recode from font encoding to chrtype
             long GrFontCharReverseRecode(const GrFont *font,unsigned int chr,int chrtype);
           get a string for the numerical fontencoding
             char *GrStrFontEncoding(int fontencoding);
           these functions enqueue an event the first in the queue
             int GrEventEnqueueFirst(GrEvent * ev);
             int GrEventParEnqueueFirst(int type, long p1, long p2, long p3, long p4);
2017-10-01 New funtion to enqueue a event by its parameters
             int GrEventParEnqueue(int type, long p1, long p2, long p3, long p4);
           Changed wait input if no events to delay(1) instead dpmi_yield in the
           djgpp version, so now demommgrx runs smoothly like other versions.
2017-09-09 ----------- mGRX 1.1.0 released
2017-09-08 Fix a proglem in jpeg read with new version 9 of libjpeg, they have 
           changed the default for cinfo.scale_denom and cinfo.scale_num.
           Fix warnings with DJGPP 2.05 in src/include/vesa.h.
2017-09-07 Changed __attribute__((packed)) by #pragma pack in fdv_win.h, to
           workarround a bug in mingw gcc.
           Fix a problem with GR_UNDERLINE_TEXT and C_OPER.
           Workarround to SetDIBColorTable fail seems on W7 with the 256 color
           driver, probably a race condition.
           Added some usual modes to the windows video driver.
           No restart test/demomgrx.c in X11 an WIN32 after running a demo.
           Some improvements to test/fontdemo.c.
2017-09-02 Setting the encoding field to the fonts provided with MGRX.
           Updated the programmer's manual.
2017-08-31 New function to save a font in own MGRX font format
             void GrDumpGrxFont(const GrFont *font,char *fileName);
2017-08-09 Corrected a very old bug in GrClearContextC and GrFloodSpillC and
           GrFloodSpillC2. They didn't restore the original context.
           Updated test/fontdemo.c
           Fixed an error in test/keys.c
2017-08-05 Fixed a warning en src/input/grev_x11.c, XKeycodeToKeysym is deprecated
           replaced by XkbKeycodeToKeysym.
2017-07-22 New function to get the real strlen of a text string of type chrtype
             int GrStrLen(const void *text, int chrtype);
           Now GrDrawString (and friends) calculates the text length (using GrStrLen)
           if the length parameter is equal to zero.
           Begining update of the programmer manual.
2017-07-16 Now the xwin driver generates GREV_EXPOSE and stop using backingstore if
           requested by the user.
           Modified the test/life.c to request GREV_EXPOSE events (and handle them). It
           is now much faster under the xwin driver.
2017-07-13 Preparation for the new GREV_EXPOSE event, added p4 to the GrEvent struct, new
           function "void GrEventGenExpose(int when)", when can be GR_GEN_EXPOSE_NO (the
           default) or GR_GEN_EXPOSE_YES.
           Updated the readme file.
2017-07-11 Replaced the GrDefaultFont define by two functions GrGetDefaultFont() and
           GrSetDefaultFont, now you can set the default font you want (set to 
           built-in GrFont_PC8x14 by default).
           New GrNextUTF8Char function.
           Added recode capacity for GR_FONTENC_MGRX512.
           Expanded test/demointl.c to test the new capacities.
2017-07-08 Setted the font encoding field to 1 in built-in pc fonts.
           New function to set the font encoding field:
             void GrFontSetEncoding(GrFont *font,int fontencoding);
           Deleted the GrProportionalTextWidth function because GrFontStringWidth works
           for both proportional and fixed fonts.
           GrFontStringWidth, GrFontStringHeight, GrCharWidth, GrCharHeight, GrCharSize,
           GrStringWidth, GrStringHeight, GrStringSize, GrDrawChar, GrDrawString (and friends)
           now recode form chrtype to font encoding if nedded (fon encoding != GR_FONTENC_UNKNOWN,
           chrtype != (GR_BYTE_TEXT || GR_WORD_TEXT) and font encoding not equivalent to chrtype.
           New function to get a chrtype equivalent to user encoding:
             char GrGetChrtypeForUserEncoding(void);
           Added maxlen parameter to GrUTF8StrToUCS2Str.
           Fixed a warning, really a bug, in src/setup/colors.c.
           GrDumpFont writes the font encoding field too.
           Changes in test/demointl and test/fontdemo to work properly.
           Added 16 new fonts "ter-mgrxNNS.psf" converted from terminus fonts, 512 glyps using
           the GR_FONTENC_MGRX512 encoding, NN can be 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 28, 32 and S b or n.
2017-07-04 Added encoding to GrFontHeader struct, it can be
             GR_FONTENC_UNKNOWN     0     /* unknow encoding (no recode) */
             GR_FONTENC_CP437       1     /* standard dos encoding */
             GR_FONTENC_CP850       2     /* standard dos encoding */
             GR_FONTENC_CP1252      3     /* standard Win encoding */
             GR_FONTENC_ISO_8859_1  4     /* standard latin encoding */
             GR_FONTENC_UNICODE     5     /* direct UNICODE encoding */
             GR_FONTENC_MGRX512     6     /* custom MGRX 512 char encoding */
             GR_FONTENC_LASTENC     6     /* last encoding, for checks */
           The new possible values of GrTextOption.txo_chrtype:
             GR_BYTE_TEXT            0   /* 1 byte per character, unknow encoding */
             GR_WORD_TEXT            1   /* 2 bytes per character, unknow encoding */
             GR_CP437_TEXT           2   /* 1 bpc standard DOS encoding */
             GR_CP850_TEXT           3   /* 1 bpc latin1 DOS encoding */
             GR_CP1252_TEXT          4   /* 1 bpc standard Win encoding */
             GR_ISO_8859_1_TEXT      5   /* 1 bpc latin1 standard in some Linux */
             GR_UTF8_TEXT            6   /* multibyte UTF-8 Unicode, restricted to 4 bytes */
             GR_UCS2_TEXT            7   /* 2 bpc restricted Unicode, only BMP range */
           New utility functions to deal with recode from GrTextOption.txo_chrtype to
           GrFontHeader.encoding:
             int  GrFontNeedRecode(const GrFont *font,int chrtype);
             unsigned int GrFontCharRecode(const GrFont *font,long chr,int chrtype);
             unsigned short *GrFontTextRecode(const GrFont *font,const void *text,int length,int chrtype);
           GrTextOption.fgcv and GrTextOption.bgcv are now GrColor values.
           Added two new fonts pc850-14.psf and pc850-16.psf, now test/demointl has a real
           CP850 coded font.
2017-07-03 Deleted the GR_ATTR_TEXT char type.
           Hided for now GrTextRegion and functions.
2017-07-02 Replaced GrGetKbEncoding and GrSetKbEncoding with
           GrGetUserEncoding and GrSetUserEncoding, these functions exists even
           if not input driver is ebabled (like with the memory driver). User
           enconding default to GRENC_UTF_8 in linux and X11, GRENC_PC437 in
           DJGPP and GRENC_PC1252 in WIn32, but the programmer can set it like
           he wants. Now key events are recoded to the user encoding.
           Changes in test/demointl and test/fontdemo to work properly.
           Small change in fd_xwin.c, accel a bit drawpixel.
           Added 32 bpp mode to vd_lnxfb.
2017-06-19 Make x86_64 the default in linux and X11.
           Fix a warning in newer versions of libPNG.
           Output format changes in test/speedtst.c.

2009-01-25 Simplified the WM_PAINT proccess to solve a race condition
           found in Vista running in multiple core cpu's.
2008-11-19 Fixed a bug in GrMouseWarp win32 version, the cursor was set to the
           screen, instead to the client area, by Richard Sanders.
2008-11-05 Added GrClearContextC function, by Richard Sanders.
2008-09-07 New MGRXBIGG environment variable, it lets the user to limit the

2008-09-06 Deleted some graphicsmodes not used anymore: GR_80_25_text,
           GR_width_height_text, GR_biggest_text, GR_width_height_color_text,
           GR_width_height_bpp_text and GR_biggest_noninterlaced_graphics

2008-02-03 ----------- mGRX 0.9.9 released
2008-02-03 Changed defaults in makedefs.grx:
           HAVE_LIBJPEG=y  HAVE_LIBPNG=y  NEED_ZLIB=y
2008-02-03 Make the w32 driver generates button4 and button5 mouse events
           (the scroll whell).
2008-02-02 Planned intl support (and 8, finished by now)
           Updated the programmer manual with the intl and GR_UTF8_TEXT support,
2008-01-30 Make textpatt.c demo program works in real color modes.
2008-01-26 Planned intl support (7)
           The functions: GrDrawString, GrPatternDrawString, GrPatternDrawStringExt,
           GrUsrDrawString, GrFontStringWidth, GrFontStringHeight,
           GrProportionalTextWidth, GrStringWidth, GrStringHeight, GrStringSize
           support the new GR_UTF8_TEXT text type, "len" must be the UTF8len or less.
           The functions: GrCharWidth, GrCharHeight, GrCharSize, GrDrawChar,
           GrPatternDrawChar, GrUsrDrawChar
           support the new GR_UTF8_TEXT text type too. "chr" must be a unique char,
           utf-8 encoded, but packed in a long (an union: long and char[4]), like it
           is packed int the GREV_KEY event.
           Some utility functions for UTF-8 are provided:
           int GrUTF8StrLen(unsigned char *s)
           long GrUCS2ToUTF8(unsigned short ch)
           unsigned short GrUTF8ToUCS2(unsigned char *s)
           unsigned short *GrUTF8StrToUCS2Str(unsigned char *s, int *ulen)
2008-01-23 Warnings fixed in fonts/fdv_bgi.c
2008-01-21 Planned intl support (6)
           Added intl support to the dj2 input driver (input/grev_dj2.c). It try
           to use the MGRXKBSYSENCODING environment variable. If not it sets
           GRENC_CP437.
           Added intl support to the w32 input driver (input/grev_w32.c). It try
           to use the MGRXKBSYSENCODING environment variable. If not it sets
           GRENC_CP1252.
           Some warnings fixed.
2008-01-20 Planned intl support (5)
           If kbsysencoding == GRENC_UTF_8, sets initial kbencoding
           to GRENC_ISO_8859_1, because is easier to handle.
           New input/auxintl.c with auxiliary intl functions
           Added intl support to the lnx input driver (input/grev_lnx.c). If the
           LANG environment variable contain "UTF-8" sets the KbSysEncoding
           to GRENC_UTF_8. If not it try to use the MGRXKBSYSENCODING
           environment variable. If not it sets GRENC_ISO_8859_1.
2008-01-19 Planned intl support (4)
           New input/recode.c recode between supported encodings.
           Added intl support to grevent.c, it process GREV_PREKEY events and
           recode if necesary.
           New test/demointl test program.
2008-01-14 Planned intl support (3)
           Added intl support to the x11 input driver (input/grev_x11.c). It try
           to open a XIM (X input method) and create a XIC (X input context), if
           it has succes, it uses Xutf8LookupString and sets the KbSysEncoding
           to GRENC_UTF_8. If it can't, uses the XLookupString and sets
           KbSysEncoding to GRENC_ISO_8859_1, but this function can't compose
           accented chars.
2008-01-12 Planned intl support (2)
           Changes in input/ninput.h to declare "int _GrGetKbSysEncoding(void)",
           internal funtion to be provided in the input drivers and the
           GrRecode function to be written.
           Added GREV_PREKEY event to mgrx.h. Input drivers with intl support
           send this ivent instead GREV_KEY, so "grevent.c" can recode it.
           Added "GrGetKbSysEncoding", "GrGetKbEncoding" and "GrSetKbEncoding"
           to input/grevent.c, do void GREV_PREKEY preprocess (to be worked
           later).
2008-01-11 Planned intl support (1)
           Changes in mgrx.h and general plan:
           - Defined the initial supported input encodings:
             #define GRENC_PC437          0   /* standard DOS encoding */
             #define GRENC_PC850          1   /* latin1 DOS encoding */
             #define GRENC_PC1252         2   /* standard Win encoding */
             #define GRENC_ISO_8859_1     3   /* standard in some Linux */
             #define GRENC_UTF_8          4   /* multibyte unicode, standard in newest Linux */
             #define GRENC_UCS_2          5   /* restricted unicode, 2 bytes, only BMP range */
           - The input driver must guess the system encoding and set an internal
             var. If unsure, the input driver will use the MGRXKBSYSENCODING
             environment variable.
           - The function "int GrGetKbSysEncoding(void)" returns the system
             encoding.
           - By default the input driver uses the system encoding in returned
             GREV_KEY events. Because now char con be a word (2 bytes) for
             UCS-2 encoding, or multibyte (limited to 4 in MGRX) for UTF-8,we
             need differ chars from special keycodes. So p2 is used to mark
             a special key with GRKEY_KEYCODE or to notify the number of bytes
             used in p1 for a char (1 to 4). The new cp1 char[4] menber event
             is a union with p1 to facilitate the use of UTF-8 returned chars.
           - The programmer can ask the input driver to recode the char to other
             of the supported encodings, before the event is returned with the
             new function "int GrSetKbEncoding(int enc)", so portable programs
             can be made for the four supported plattforms. It returns "1" if
             ok, or "0" else.
           - The function "int GrGetKbEncoding(void)" returns the actual encoding
             in use for the input driver.
           - A new character type "GR_UTF8_TEXT" is defined for use in the text
             drawing functions, but is to the programmer to use a font wiht the
             same encoding that the text to be drawn (by example a ISO-8859-1
             font is ok for UTF-8 text).

2007-11-07 Simplify the include/arith.h code.
2007-06-09 ----------- mGRX 0.9.7 released
2007-06-03 The djgpp delay function doesn't work on WinXP and W2000. It is
           corrected in the djgpp CVS version. We included the source for the
           new delay in src/misc. When a new djgpp version will be released
           this source code will be removed.
2007-06-01 The X11 driver now uses a pixmap for backin store and responds to
           Expose events. But it is a bit slowly. If you want a faster driver
           edit src/include/libxwin.h and set USE_PIXMAP_FOR_BS to 0.
2007-06-01 GrEventRead now waits 1 msec if no event is ready, so now MGRX
           programs doesn't load the cpu 100%.
2007-06-01 GrSleep calls XFlush in the X11 platform, to flush the graphics
           queue before wait.

2006-02-17 ----------- mGRX 0.9.4 released
2006-02-10 Better understanding of x86_64. Now by default an i386
           library is built even on x86_64 platforms. If you set
           BUILD_X86_64 to 'y' in makdefs.grx a x86_64 library is
           built, and the install target go to the lib64 subdir
